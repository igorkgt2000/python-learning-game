## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation
```bash
# Clone or download the project
cd python_learning_game

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the game
python main.py
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run tests
python test_game.py

# Run demo
python demo.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Launch the Game**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Start a Level**: Click "Start Game" to begin
3. **Write Code**: Use the code editor to write Python functions
4. **Execute Code**: Click "Run Code" or press Ctrl+R
5. **Complete Objectives**: Navigate to goals and collect gems

### Available Functions

#### Movement Functions
- `move_forward()` - Move one step forward
- `turn_left()` - Turn left 90 degrees
- `turn_right()` - Turn right 90 degrees
- `turn_around()` - Turn 180 degrees

#### Sensing Functions
- `is_clear()` - Check if path ahead is clear
- `is_gem()` - Check if current position has a gem
- `is_goal()` - Check if current position is the goal
- `at_goal()` - Alias for is_goal()

#### Information Functions
- `get_position()` - Get current (x, y) position
- `get_direction()` - Get current direction
- `get_gem_count()` - Get number of gems remaining

### Code Examples

#### Basic Movement
```python
# Move forward 3 steps
move_forward()
move_forward()
move_forward()
```

#### Using Loops
```python
# Move forward 5 times using a loop
for i in range(5):
    move_forward()
```

#### Conditional Logic
```python
# Move forward while path is clear
while is_clear():
    move_forward()
```

#### Function Definition
```python
# Define a custom function
def move_square():
    for i in range(4):
        move_forward()
        turn_right()

# Use the function
move_square()
```
