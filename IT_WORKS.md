## 🎮 HOW TO PLAY RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Launch the Game
```bash
cd /home/igorkgt/ai_workspace/python_learning_game
python3 main.py
```

### Step 2: Click "Start Game"
The game will:
1. Load Level 1 ("First Steps")
2. Show pixel art game in left panel
3. Show code editor in right panel
4. Display hint: "Use move_forward() to reach the green goal!"

### Step 3: Write Your Code
In the code editor (right side), write:
```python
move_forward()
move_forward()
```

### Step 4: Click "Run Code"
- Your code executes in the game!
- Player moves forward twice
- Should reach the goal!
- Output shows: "✓ Code executed successfully"

### Step 5: Complete Level 1!
If you reached the goal, you beat the level! 🎉

## 🎓 Learning Progression

The game teaches Python through 30 levels:

1. **Level 1-5:** Basic commands (`move_forward()`)
2. **Level 6-10:** For loops (`for i in range(5)`)
3. **Level 11-15:** Conditionals (`if is_clear()`)
4. **Level 16-20:** While loops (`while not is_goal()`)
5. **Level 21-25:** Functions (`def move_square()`)
6. **Level 26-30:** Lists & algorithms

Each level builds on the previous, creating a smooth learning curve!

## 🔥 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Real Python Code**
Students write ACTUAL Python, not pseudo-code!

### 2. **Immediate Visual Feedback**
See your code execute in real-time with animations!

### 3. **Secure Execution**
AST validation prevents any dangerous code!

### 4. **Progressive Difficulty**
From "move forward twice" to "recursive pathfinding"!

### 5. **Beautiful Graphics**
Pixel art that's both functional and charming!

### 6. **Comprehensive Documentation**
Every function explained for learning!
