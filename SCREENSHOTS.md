```

**What this teaches:** Conditionals (`if is_clear()`) + loops + pathfinding

**Solution requires:**
```python
# Students need to think algorithmically!
while not is_goal():
    if is_clear():
        move_forward()
    else:
        turn_right()
    
    if is_gem():
        pass  # Auto-collected
```

💡 Hint:
  Try recursion! 
  def move_to_goal(): 
      if not is_goal(): 
          move_forward()
          move_to_goal()
  Mind the base case!
```

**What this teaches:** Recursion + function definitions

**Solution:**
```python
def move_to_goal():
    if not is_goal():
        move_forward()
        move_to_goal()

move_to_goal()
```

## 🎮 Screenshot 6: Documentation Sample

**File:** `src/core/player.py`

```python
"""
Player character with movement, turning, and sensing capabilities.

This module implements the Player class, which represents the 
programmable character that students control with Python code.

Key Features:
    - Movement: move_forward() to advance in current direction
    - Turning: turn_left(), turn_right(), turn_around()
    - Sensing: is_clear(), is_gem(), is_goal()
    - State: Position (x, y), direction (N/E/S/W)

Example Usage:
    >>> player = Player(x=0, y=0)
    >>> player.move_forward()
    >>> player.turn_right()
    >>> player.position
    (1, 0)
"""

class Player:
    """
    The programmable character controlled by student code.
    
    Attributes:
        x (int): Current column position (0 = leftmost)
        y (int): Current row position (0 = topmost)
        direction (Direction): Current facing direction
        collected_gems (set): Set of gem coordinates collected
        step_count (int): Total steps taken in current level
    
    Coordinate System:
        Origin (0,0) is TOP-LEFT corner
        X increases rightward →
        Y increases downward ↓
        
        Grid Example (3x3):
            0   1   2  (X →)
          ┌───┬───┬───┐
        0 │   │   │   │
          ├───┼───┼───┤
        1 │   │ P │   │  (Y ↓)
          ├───┼───┼───┤
        2 │   │   │   │
          └───┴───┴───┘
    """
    
    def move_forward(self):
        """
        Move one tile forward in current direction.
        
        This is the primary movement command. The player advances
        one grid cell in the direction they're currently facing.
        The step counter increments with each move.
        
        Direction Mapping:
            NORTH: y decreases (move up)
            SOUTH: y increases (move down)
            EAST:  x increases (move right)
            WEST:  x decreases (move left)
        
        Side Effects:
            - Updates self.x and/or self.y
            - Increments self.step_count
            - Does NOT check for collisions (grid handles that)
            - Does NOT collect gems (game logic handles that)
        
        Example:
            >>> player = Player(x=1, y=1)
            >>> player.direction = Direction.NORTH
            >>> player.move_forward()
            >>> player.position
            (1, 0)  # Moved up
            >>> player.step_count
            1
        """
        # ... (implementation follows)
```

**Every single function has this level of detail!**
