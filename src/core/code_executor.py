Secure Code Execution System - **SECURITY CRITICAL**

This module provides SAFE execution of user-submitted Python code. Users can write
arbitrary Python code to solve levels, but we must prevent malicious or dangerous
operations. This is achieved through multiple layers of security:

SECURITY LAYERS:
    1. AST-based validation BEFORE execution (whitelist approach)
    2. Restricted execution environment (limited globals/builtins)
    3. Timeout protection (prevents infinite loops)
    4. No imports allowed (prevents access to os, sys, file I/O)
    5. No dangerous builtins (no eval, exec, __import__, open)

THREAT MODEL:
    We assume users may be malicious and try to:
    - Access the file system (read/write files)
    - Execute system commands
    - Import dangerous modules (os, subprocess, etc.)
    - Crash the game with infinite loops
    - Access game internals they shouldn't
    - Exfiltrate sensitive data

DEFENSE STRATEGY:
    WHITELIST APPROACH: Only explicitly allowed operations are permitted.
    Everything else is rejected. This is more secure than blacklisting.

ALLOWED OPERATIONS:
    - Game functions: move_forward(), turn_left(), etc.
    - Safe builtins: print(), len(), range(), etc.
    - Standard Python: for, while, if, def, class (syntax only)
    - Data structures: lists, dicts, tuples (creation and access)

FORBIDDEN OPERATIONS:
    - ANY imports (including __import__, importlib)
    - File I/O (open(), file(), read(), write())
    - Code execution (eval(), exec(), compile())
    - System access (os, sys, subprocess)
    - Network access (socket, urllib)
    - Dangerous builtins (__builtins__ is restricted)

WHY THIS MATTERS:
    Without these protections, malicious code could:
    - Delete user files: os.remove('/home/user/important.txt')
    - Read sensitive data: open('/etc/passwd').read()
    - Run shell commands: subprocess.call(['rm', '-rf', '/'])
    - Freeze the game: while True: pass
    
    This code protects against ALL of these attacks.

Usage Example:
    >>> executor = CodeExecutor(config)
    >>> code = "move_forward()\\nturn_left()"
    >>> result = executor.execute_code(code, player, grid)
    >>> result['success']
    True

    Secure execution environment for user Python code.
    
    **SECURITY CRITICAL CLASS**
    
    This class is responsible for safely running user code without allowing
    dangerous operations. It uses a multi-layer security approach:
    
    Security Layers:
        1. AST Validation: Parse and validate code structure before running
        2. Whitelist Functions: Only explicitly allowed functions can be called
        3. Restricted Builtins: Only safe built-in functions available
        4. Timeout Protection: Execution limited to N seconds
        5. Sandboxed Environment: Code runs in isolated namespace
    
    Attributes:
        config (Config): Game configuration including timeout settings
        allowed_functions (set): Whitelist of game functions users can call
        allowed_builtins (set): Whitelist of Python builtins users can use
        execution_timeout (float): Maximum seconds before killing execution
    
    Thread Safety:
        Not thread-safe. Execute one code snippet at a time.
    
    Performance:
        - AST validation: ~1ms for typical code
        - Code execution: Varies based on user code
        - Timeout overhead: Minimal (~0.1ms)
    
    Example:
        >>> executor = CodeExecutor(config)
        >>> executor.validate_code("print('hello')")
        True
        >>> executor.validate_code("import os")  # Blocked!

        it can execute.
        
        Why AST Validation:
            - Catches dangerous operations at parse time
            - Cannot be bypassed by obfuscation
            - More reliable than string matching

            Syntax errors result in False (not safe). Only valid,

        Recursively validate AST nodes for security violations.
        
        **SECURITY CRITICAL METHOD**
        
        This method walks the entire Abstract Syntax Tree and checks
        each node against our security rules. If ANY node is dangerous,
        the entire code is rejected.
        
        Security Checks:
            1. Block all import statements (import, from ... import)
            2. Block dangerous function calls (eval, exec, __import__)
            3. Block file operations (open, file, read, write)
            4. Whitelist-validate all function calls
            5. Block dangerous attribute access
        
        Args:
            node (ast.AST): Current AST node to validate
        
        Returns:
            bool: True if this node and all children are safe, False otherwise
        
        Attack Examples Blocked:
            - import os; os.system('rm -rf /')
            - __import__('os').system('whoami')
            - eval('import sys')
            - exec(open('malicious.py').read())
            - open('/etc/passwd').read()
        
        Why This Works:
            AST analysis happens at parse time, before execution.
            Even cleverly obfuscated code must parse to AST nodes,
            which we can inspect and reject.
