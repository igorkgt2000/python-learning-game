"""
Grid System - 2D tile-based world representation.

This module defines the Grid class which represents the game world as a 2D array
of tiles. Each tile can be empty, a wall, a gem, or a goal. The grid handles
collision detection, gem collection, and pathfinding support.

Architecture:
    - Grid is a 2D list indexed as grid[y][x] (row-major order)
    - Special tiles (gems, goals) are tracked in separate lists for efficiency
    - Coordinate system matches screen coordinates (0,0 = top-left)
    - Out-of-bounds positions are treated as walls for safety

Data Structure:
    tiles[y][x] = TileType enum value
    
    Example 3x3 grid:
    tiles[0] = [EMPTY, WALL,  EMPTY]  <- Row 0 (y=0)
    tiles[1] = [GEM,   EMPTY, EMPTY]  <- Row 1 (y=1)
    tiles[2] = [EMPTY, EMPTY, GOAL]   <- Row 2 (y=2)
               ^       ^      ^
               x=0     x=1    x=2

Usage Example:
    >>> grid = Grid(10, 10)
    >>> grid.set_tile(5, 5, TileType.WALL)
    >>> grid.is_wall(5, 5)
    True
    >>> grid.set_tile(3, 3, TileType.GEM)
    >>> grid.collect_gem(3, 3)
    True

class TileType(Enum):
    """
    Enumeration of all possible tile types in the game world.
    
    Each tile in the grid has exactly one type. The type determines:
    - Visual appearance (which sprite to render)
    - Collision behavior (can player move through it?)
    - Interaction behavior (what happens when player enters?)
    
    Tile Types:
        EMPTY: Walkable empty space, default tile type
        WALL: Solid obstacle, blocks player movement
        GEM: Collectible item, removed when player walks over it
        GOAL: Victory condition, level completes when reached
    
    Note:
        Player position is NOT stored in the grid. The Player object
        maintains its own (x, y) coordinates which reference grid tiles.
    """
    EMPTY = "empty"  # Default walkable tile

class Grid:

    2D tile-based world representation.
    
    The Grid stores the game world as a 2D array of TileType values.
    It handles collision detection, gem collection, and provides
    utilities for pathfinding and level validation.
    
    Attributes:
        width (int): Number of tiles horizontally (X-axis)
        height (int): Number of tiles vertically (Y-axis)
        tiles (List[List[TileType]]): 2D array of tile types [y][x]
        gems (List[Tuple[int, int]]): Positions of all remaining gems
        goals (List[Tuple[int, int]]): Positions of all goal tiles
    
    Coordinate System:
        (0,0) is top-left corner
        X increases rightward (columns)
        Y increases downward (rows)
        Access pattern: tiles[y][x]
    
    Performance:
        - Tile lookup: O(1) - direct array access
        - Gem count: O(1) - tracked in separate list
        - Neighbor lookup: O(1) - maximum 4 neighbors
    
    Example:
        >>> grid = Grid(10, 10)
        >>> grid.set_tile(5, 3, TileType.WALL)
        >>> grid.is_valid_position(5, 3)
