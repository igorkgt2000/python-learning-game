"""
Sprite management system for loading and animating pixel art sprites.

This module handles all sprite assets for the game including:
- Loading sprites from PNG files
- Caching sprites in memory for fast access
- Managing multi-frame animations
- Scaling sprites to requested sizes
- Tracking animation timers and current frames

All sprites are located in assets/sprites/ and are automatically
loaded on initialization. Animations are updated frame-by-frame.

Classes:
    SpriteManager: Main sprite loading and animation manager

Sprite Naming Convention:
    - player_{direction}_{frame}.png  (e.g., player_north_0.png)
    - tile_{type}.png                 (e.g., tile_floor.png)
    - gem_{frame}.png                 (e.g., gem_0.png)
    - goal_{frame}.png                (e.g., goal_0.png)
    - particle_{color}.png            (e.g., particle_gem_yellow.png)

    3. Managing animations (frame progression)
